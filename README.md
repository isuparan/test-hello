1st try
I have to select:
1. Professional
2. Developer
3. Hobbyist
but I am all of them!
I am an IT Director (with an MBA degree), I have wrote programs (FORTRAN as a student many decades ago, BASIC for my home security system, Z80 machine language (for a robotic call device, which hardware I designed myself), a short Z80 code for remote monitoring and control of a balloon or rocket payload (I studied at German's MORABA/DFVLR) and just simple HTML for websites (for friends only). Currently I crashed two (or three?) notebooks installig Windows 10, Kali and Ubuntu, fortunately one of it is still under warranty).
I also bought an Arduino project, to be completed during next few weeks for a robot-home (still waiting for the motors).
